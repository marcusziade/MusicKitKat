# Apple Music Go SDK Project Plan

## Overview
A comprehensive Go SDK for Apple Music that allows developers to integrate Apple Music functionality into their Go applications with minimal friction.

## Core Components

### 1. Authentication Module
- Developer token generation using JWT
- User authentication with OAuth 2.0
- Automatic token refresh logic
- Secure token storage recommendations

### 2. API Client Structure
- Base client with configurable options
- HTTP request handling with proper retry logic
- Rate limit awareness and backoff strategies
- Well-defined error types and handling

### 3. Resource Services
- Catalog services (songs, albums, artists, music videos)
- Library services (user's library management)
- Playlist services (creation, modification, deletion)
- Search functionality with filtering options
- Recommendations and featured content
- Station and radio endpoints

### 4. Models
- Strongly typed structs for all Apple Music resources
- JSON marshaling/unmarshaling support
- Helper methods for common operations
- Relationship handling between resources

### 5. Streaming Support
- Playback functionality
- Stream quality configuration
- Playback position tracking
- DRM compliance handling

## Architecture Guidelines

### Client Design
- Follow Go idioms and best practices
- Make intelligent use of interfaces for testability
- Provide sensible defaults with customization options
- Support context for cancellation and timeouts

### Error Handling
- Well-defined error types
- Contextual error information
- Distinction between API errors and SDK errors
- Recovery strategies for common failures

### Configuration
- Support for environment variables
- Configuration via code and/or files
- Customizable HTTP client options
- Logging options with different verbosity levels
